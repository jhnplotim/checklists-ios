Checklist App

Checklist app based on the tutorial on Raywenderlich that can be found at:

https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/ios-apprentice/v8.3/chapters/9-table-views


The app lets you organize to-do items into lists and then check off these items once you’ve completed them. You can also set a reminder on a to-do item that will make the iPhone pop up an alert on the due date, even when the app isn’t running.

The app is built using the MVVM+C (Coordinators) pattern
