Checklist App

Checklist app based on the tutorial on Raywenderlich that can be found at:

https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/ios-apprentice/v8.3/chapters/9-table-views


The app lets you organize to-do items into lists and then check off these items once you’ve completed them. You can also set a reminder on a to-do item that will make the iPhone pop up an alert on the due date, even when the app isn’t running.

The app is built using the MVVM+C (Coordinators) pattern



NOTE: Do NOT commit the package.resolved file when you build your project. It is currently not committed to ensure the app builds successfully on GitHub and also supports different versions of XCode. If you add a new library, commit, the project file but not the package.resolved file.
